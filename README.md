# Hi

### Instructions for Starting the React Application

1. Begin by cloning the project using the command: <br>
   `git clone https://github.com/sangmesh04/alemeno-react.git` <br>
   _This will download the **alemeno-react** folder._

2. Navigate to the **alemeno-react** folder and open your terminal.

3. Install all the necessary dependencies for the project by running: <br>
   `npm install`

4. After a few moments, the _node_modules_ will be downloaded. Next, initiate the client server with: <br>
   `npm start`

5. The server will take a short while to start up. Once it's ready, the application will be accessible at localhost on port 3000.

6. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the application.
